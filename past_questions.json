    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "Newton's First Law states that a body at rest remains at rest, and a body in motion remains in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force. Because it describes a body's natural resistance to change (inertia), it is called the Law of Inertia."
