    "question": "What is the fundamental frequency of a closed pipe that is 2 metres long? (Speed of sound = 340 m/s)",
    "options": {
      "A": "42.5 Hz",
      "B": "85 Hz",
      "C": "170 Hz",
      "D": "340 Hz"
    },
    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "For a closed pipe (closed at one end), the fundamental frequency = v/4L = 340/(4×2) = 340/8 = 42.5 Hz. A closed pipe has a node at the closed end and antinode at the open end, fitting only a quarter wavelength at the fundamental. Higher harmonics (odd only) occur at 3f₀, 5f₀, etc.",

    "question": "Two waves of the same frequency and amplitude are superposed. If they are in phase, what is the resulting amplitude?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Zero",

      "C": "Equal to the individual amplitude",
      "D": "Twice the individual amplitude"
    },
    "correct": "D",
    "explanation": "When two waves of equal amplitude A are in phase (phase difference = 0), constructive interference occurs. The resultant amplitude = A + A = 2A (twice the individual amplitude). When they are 180° out of phase, destructive interference gives amplitude = 0.",

    "explanation": "Wavelength λ = v/f = 343/500 = 0.686 m. The wave equation v = fλ connects speed, frequency, and wavelength. Higher frequency → shorter wavelength for the same speed.",
